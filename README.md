# Used Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning

This project aims to predict used car prices using advanced machine learning and clustering techniques. Based on a dataset of over 4,000 car listings, we explored key factors influencing pricing, such as mileage, horsepower, and engine displacement. Our best-performing model, Random Forest, achieved an RMSE of 0.669 and an R² of 0.411.

Key Features
